            <h2>Video game collection and preservation</h2>
            <p>I've collected video games and video game consoles for well over 8 years now. <br>
            I've done this with my dad. We have gotten stuff from garage sales, recycling, thrift/pawn shops, and many other places. <br>
            Pictures here:</p>
            
            <h2>Soldering</h2>
            <p>Soldering is a hobby I have taken up in the past 5 or so years. <br>
            I've done video game console repairs and mods to bring back and/or more functionality to these older consoles</p>

            <p>Modbo 5.0D, Pic Fix, and IDE ressurector<br><br>
            The Modbo allows for imported games to be played as well as add a custom bios.<br>
            This bios alllows for unsigned code to run as well as boot into custom options.<br>
            The Pic Fix will turn off the console if it dectects the laser will crash a specfic<br>
            chip on the board that has the potential to burn it out. The IDE ressurector<br>
            Rebuilds the IDE hard drive circuit that was left ofver during the first PS2 Slim<br>
            revision. This allows you to get an IDE to SD adapter and wire up a micro usb.<br>
            From there, you can put games on the SD card so in the event the drive fails, you can<br>
            still play games as long as you have a backup of them.</p>

            <h3>NeoGeo CD</h3>
            <p>NeoGeo CD SD Loader<br><br>
            This allows the NeoGeo CD to run games off a micro usb.<br>
            this is useful as it loads 4x faster than the regular CD drive.<br>
            also has the added benefit of changing regions.</p>
